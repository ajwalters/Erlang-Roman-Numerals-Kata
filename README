Roman numeral convertor written in Erlang.

Currently only converts arabic numbers to roman numerals.

Example Usage:
$> arabic_to_roman:convert(2).
"II"
$> arabic_to_roman:convert(4).
"IV"
$> arabic_to_roman:convert(109).
"CIX"

This kata was based off the Roman Numberals Ruby Quiz (http://rubyquiz.com/quiz22.html).
I only implemented the arabic to roman conversion and will return to the corresponding 
challenge on a rainy day.

The exercise was done test-first.  All tests can be found in test_arabic_to_roman.erl

Feed appreciated!
